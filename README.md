# Fineboy's Bible
how to be a fine guy like me.

# First Step :
Be nice to all people even if they piss you off.

# Second Step :
don't talk too much.

# Third step :
Silently watch the conversation and send only emotes.

# BONUS Step :
Listen to "lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to" all the time, you'll be extra fine with that.
